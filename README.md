Hi 👋 I'm Rafal
================================

### Software Quality | Test Automation | Playwright Enthusiast

I'm Rafal Jablonski, a QA professional with 8+ years of experience in the field.
I've held various roles, such as Manual Tester, Test Analyst, Test Leader, and Test Manager, that have given me a broad perspective on the testing process.

Currently, I'm working as a **Quality Engineering Architect** on a project for a client from the automotive industry.
My main focus is on shaping quality processes for a team of 50 people, and I create end-to-end automated tests using **Cypress with TypeScript**.
In the past, I've worked with various automated testing technologies and frameworks, including Selenium with Java.

I love learning about new technologies. I'm always looking for simple but effective solutions.
Recently, in my free time, I've been developing my knowledge of the **Playwright** framework with **TypeScript and Python**.

I believe that quality is paramount in software development, and I'm committed to ensuring that the software I work on is of the highest quality.
Let's connect and build something great together!
